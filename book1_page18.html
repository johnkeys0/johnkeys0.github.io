            Jack was hanging on by a tread, but he regained his composure 
            and was able to help out Cassandra. They arrived to the entrance
             inside the cave, but it was guarded by two demons and as such the
              fighting began. Cassandra was fighting one of them while Alex was
               fighting the other one, Jack stayed behind. Alex only got a small
                amount of demon hunting training and because of that the demon 
                got away and lunged itself at Jack. Cassandra saved him once more,
                 because she managed to kill the other demon just in time.
