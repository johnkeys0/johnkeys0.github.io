        <p>Five teens gathered around a circle drawn from their blood. One of them held a book
         in their hand and began enchanting something when suddenly a demon appeared. They began
          to flee, but they were brutally murdered one by one except Jack, who survived and ran away 
          with the book in his hand. He could not believe his eyes. He thought all of this demon stuff
           was nothing but a joke like Bloody Mary or the Boogeyman, but he realized how wrong he was.
            With nothing left to do and with grief in his heart, he began to search for a way to stop 
            the demon, inside the book. The book is from one of the friends who died and Jack has no idea
            from where the book came from. The only thing he knows is that he got no time to waste
            overthinking things.
