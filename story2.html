            <p>Five teens gathered around a circle drawn from their blood. One of them held a book in their hand and began enchanting something when suddenly a demon appeared. They began to flee, but they were brutally murdered one by one except Jack, who survived and ran away with the book in his hand. He could not believe his eyes. He thought all of this demon stuff was nothing but a joke like Bloody Mary or the Boogeyman, but he realized how wrong he was. With nothing left to do and with grief in his heart, he began to search for a way to stop the demon, inside the book. The book is from one of the friends who died and Jack has no idea from where the book came from. The only thing he knows is that he got no time to waste overthinking things. After a while he found the page that said a demon can be put to rest by the blood of those who summoned him. He began to think how to get back to that place. “Probably the demon was waiting for him” – that was the thought he had when he heard a strange noise coming from the front door. It was one of the demons spawn that came after him. He had no choice, but to flee once again and he returned safely to the house where him and his friends summoned the great demon. Jack saw from the windows that the demon was not there only its spawn protecting the dead bodies of his friends. There was no choice, he had to get inside somehow. He came up with a plan. He made some noise for the demons to get out and he entered from the backdoor. When he saw his buddies he almost cried, but he had to keep his composure. He took the vial they used for the ritual, because it contained their blood. As he was trying to leave the house from the backdoor a demon saw him from the right side and began to chase him. Multiple demons were chasing Jack until he was surrounded by them. “This is the end” – Jack thought, when he heard gunshots and one of the demons got murdered. The rest recognized the person responsible for killing their partner and in fear they ran away. Her name was Cassandra. 
<br>Cassandra:
<br>“I am from the demon hunters association. There is nothing to fear.”
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Thanks for saving my life
<br>
<br>Cassandra:
<br>No problem, but why were the demons chasing you and what is that book doing in your hand?
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Well… you see… me and my buddies might be responsible for summoning a demon.
<br>Cass:
<br>Might be?! I am taking you to the chairman immediately.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Who?
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>Don’t worry, you’ll know him in due time.
<br>
<br>As they were going to meet the chairman, Jack began to ponder about the foolish mistake he and his friends made. He wishes to turn back time, but such a thing is not possible, so the least he can do is fix his mistake before more people get hurt.
<br>Meeting Julius
<br>They arrived at the Demon Hunters Association Headquarters. They went to Julius’s office that was upstairs. After a knock on the door the were let inside.
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>Good day to you chairman. I brought the idiot responsible for summoning THAT demon.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Hey!
<br>Julius:
<br>I see. Where is the book now?
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>Right here. – She gave the book to Julius.
<br>
<br>Julius:
<br>Good Job Cassandra! What is your name young man.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>It’s Jack, sir.
<br>
<br>Julius:
<br>Nice to meet you Jack, I’m Julius. You see this has been missing for quite some time now. Someone stole it from our library.
<br>Jack:
<br>It must have been my friend. He got it from somewhere, but I didn’t ask question because I thought all this demon stuff was a joke, a fun way to spend time. I was very wrong.
<br>
<br>Julius:
<br>We know. In fact we’ve been on your track for quite some time, but due to the lack of manpower we were very late. You see, the demon you summoned is one of the most powerful, if not the MOST powerful demon. It’s name is Armageddon. Quite a fitting name for it’s strength if you ask me. Now we must stop him, so I ask: Will you help us Jack?
<br>Cass:
<br>With all due respect sir, you cannot…
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>I’ll do everything in my power to help.
<br>
<br>Julius:
<br>I’m glad to hear that. Now back to the topic at hand. This demon is hiding inside a cave and the only entrance is on top of a mountain. We could drill a hole or climb the mountain using a helicopter, but those would alert it of our location.
<br>So the only thing we can do is climb the mountain and explore the cave to find where the demon resides. For this reason, the association hired an expert mountain climber named Alexandre who is also an expert in the layout of the cave. You’ll meet him tomorrow morning, but now go get some rest. Cassandra would you show Jack to his chambers, please.
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>Of course, sir!
<br>
<br>Jack and Cassandra left Julius’ office and headed towards Jack’s chamber.
<br>Cass:
<br>This is your room. Good night!
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Good night to you too and thank you!
<br>
<br>Cassandra headed back while Jack went inside his spacious and beautiful room.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>This association got money.
<br>
<br>He changed into the pajamas given to him and laid down on his bed and wondered about all that’s happened and about all the new people he met. He wondered about the fate of his friends and he wished if he could have done anything differently and ultimately he blamed himself for being a fool. Finally he went to sleep.
<br>The Journey begins 
<br>
<br>The morning arrived and Jack got ready for breakfast. At the breakfast table he met Alexandre.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Hi! You must be Alexandre, I’m Jack. Nice to meet you!
<br>
<br>Alex:
<br>Hi Jack! Nice to meet you too! I’ll be your guide! Let’s eat than we should get ready for the long road ahead. I already have all the essential things prepared, but you should pack clothes and other stuff. They got ready and ventured out into the wild. They arrived at the bottom of the mountain.
<br>
<br>Alex:
<br>We should set up camp here than we’ll take turns to watch the camp: first me than Cassandra and Finally Jack.
<br>
<br>Jack and Cass:
<br>Understood!
<br>
<br>Jack went to sleep on the uncomfortable ground. He in not much of a camping fan, but there was nothing else he could do about it. He couldn’t sleep much because he was woken up by Cassandra.
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>Jack! It’s your turn to watch.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>I understand. Did anything worth mentioning happen!
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>No, just some squirrels and bunnies, nothing out of the ordinary.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>I see. Well, anyway thanks for waking me up.
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>No problem.
<br>
<br>Jack stood next to the fire and waited for something to happen, but nothing did, until he heard some weird noise. It was a pack of wolves that surrounded the camp. One of the wolves launched itself onto Jack. He had no idea what to do next, so he yelled as loud as he could until he heard a gunshot. It was Cassandra who shot the wolf and saved him. With that the others got scared and ran away howling in the night. Alexandre finally woke up and they explained what had happened and morning finally arrived.
<br>
<br>Alex:
<br>We should get going and hide our scent. The wolves might come back to exact revenge upon their dead friend.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>I don’t think they will. Cassandra scared them pretty good.
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>Yes, I did!
<br>
<br>Alex:
<br>Let’s hope the two of you are right.
<br>
<br>After that they geared up and began the climb. Both Jack and Cassandra had some mountain climbing experience. Jack is reckless and loves adrenaline so he tried out many forms of sport: from mountain climbing to mountain biking, he even bungee jumped once. Cassandra’s demon hunting training incorporated a lot of things, including mountain climbing. They began to ascend the mountain. Alexandre in front, Jack behind him and finally Cassandra. As they were climbing Cassandra slipped and was floating in the air. Jack was hanging on by a tread, but he regained his composure and was able to help out Cassandra. They arrived to the entrance inside the cave, but it was guarded by two demons and as such the fighting began. Cassandra was fighting one of them while Alex was fighting the other one, Jack stayed behind. Alex only got a small amount of demon hunting training and because of that the demon got away and lunged itself at Jack. Cassandra saved him once more, because she managed to kill the other demon just in time.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>It appears you saved me again. How many times is it now.
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>Three, but don’t fret about it.
<br>
<br>They set up camp out in front of the entrance and Alexandre took out a map and began to explain the layout of the cave.
<br>
<br>Alex:
<br>There is a large chamber inside the cave that is probably where the demon resides. Our mission is to ascertain whether or not the intel about the demons location was correct. If it was we’ll report back.
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>Understood!
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>How do we get there?
<br>
<br>Alex:
<br>There are two paths: one leads straight inside the chamber, while the other one leads you to a balcony that lets you see inside it. We’ll go on the latter route, but for now we’ll get some rest.
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>Are you asleep?
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>No.
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>You’re handling all this demon stuff better than I thought.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Well, don’t let appearances fool you. I am freaked out by all of this, but I have a responsibility to end this, especially because I am partly responsible for starting it in the first place.
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>There is no need to blame yourself, even if you are responsible, because it will destroy you.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Thanks.
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>Well… anyway… rest up, tomorrow will be a big day.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>I will. Good night!
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>Good night!
<br>
<br>Tomorrow arrived.
<br>
<br>Alex:
<br>It’s time for us to venture inside the cave. Be on your guard for any demons we might encounter.
<br>
<br>Cass and Jack:
<br>Understood.
<br>They went inside the cave when suddenly Jack tripped and made some noise. Everybody froze, but nothing happened.
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>This is strange, there are no demons here. I wonder what’s going on. Regardless, we should be careful.
<br>
<br>They arrived at their destination.
<br>
<br>Cass:
<br>There is nobody here! I say this again, but what is going on!
<br>
<br>They hear a noise from behind.
<br>
<br>Demon:
<br>Hello!
<br>The encounter
<br>Alex:
<br>On you guard, everyone!
<br>
<br>Jack and Cass:
<br>Understood!
<br>
<br>Armageddon:
<br>Now you die!
<br>
<br>They couldn’t believe their eyes. Jack and Alex froze in place, but Cassandra brought a special spellbook with her that can send back a demon, so there was no need to worry. Cassandra was able to stop the demon, even thou it was a tough battle. After the battle, they went back home where they explained to Julius what had happened.
<br>
<br>Julius:
<br>Great work everyone!
<br>
<br>Everyone:
<br>Thank you, sir!
<br>
<br>Julius:
<br>Jack. Would you like to join the demon hunters association?
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>That would be a great honor. Yes I would!
<br>
<br>Julius:
<br>Great! Now with the demon defeated your training starts tomorrow.
<br>Jack:
<br>Understood.
<br>
<br>This is how Jack became a demon hunter. He would not have even dreamed of ever becoming a hunter, but here we are. 
<br>The end.
