            Both Jack and Cassandra had some mountain climbing 
            experience. Jack is reckless and loves adrenaline so
             he tried out many forms of sport: from mountain 
             climbing to mountain biking, he even bungee jumped 
             once. Cassandraâ€™s demon hunting training incorporated 
             a lot of things, including mountain climbing. They 
             began to ascend the mountain. Alexandre in front, 
             Jack behind him and finally Cassandra. As they were 
             climbing Cassandra slipped and was floating in the air.
