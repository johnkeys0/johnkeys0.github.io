                 Three teenagers: Jack and his friends decided to enter a haunted house. They began to look around. Even something like the floor creaking scared them. They moved slowly and quietly. The house was old and abandoned, like any haunted house. Suddenly a door closed itself right in front of them. Jack got scared and ran out of the house as fast as humanly possible, when suddenly he wasn’t in the same neighborhood as before. He looked back to check on his friends, but they were not there anymore. The new neighborhood looked something like this: three rows, the first and third row had the same house repeating over and over while the second row had a road going to infinity. Jack was confused, he could not believe his eyes. He became stressed. He checked a house and the same thing awaited him, he went thru the backyard, the same thing. Nothing made sense, when suddenly he opened a door and was in a new place altogether. The door behind him was so tall he couldn’t reach to open it and as such, the ceiling was high up as well. He heard something: someone was cutting something. There was a room next to him, a kitchen, where there was a man cutting meat. He looked strange: instead of his eyes he had clocks. “The clockman” – Jack thought to himself. He looked at Jack and stopped what he was doing. Went to Jack slowly, grabbed him and ate him. Jack could do nothing, his fate was sealed. Or was it? Suddenly he appeared in a different place: in the middle of the ocean. “What just happened?” – Jack asked, when suddenly a shark started to chase him. He began to swim as fast as he could. “A ship” – Jack remarked, because there was an empty ship lying in the middle of nowhere. Jack got on top of the ship and was saved from the shark. “Finally I can get some rest”. A storm was coming. There was no time for rest. Jack sailed bravely and brilliantly until the ship sunk and Jack sunk with it as well. He woke up on the beach. Somehow he survived. There was a group of pirates stranded on the beach with him. They spoke a strange language, but one thing was clear: they wanted to cook Jack alive and eat him because they were starving. Once again Jack could do nothing. Suddenly they could hear: “He’s mine!”. The clockman appeared, killed all the pirates and killed Jack as well. 
<br>Jack was now in modern Tokyo. So many people, everyone hurrying to go somewhere. In the crowd Jack saw the clockman coming towards him. He began to run as fast as he could. He entered into a shop run by an elderly woman. 
<br>
<br>Elderly woman:
<br>Time is mans greatest enemy. Nobody can escape it, even if they tried.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Is there another way to exit this building?
<br>
<br>Elderly woman:
<br>Yes, in the back.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Thank you.
<br>
<br>When he arrived outside, the clockman was waiting for him and once again killed him. 
<br>Jack appeared in the middle of a desert. He saw a city and headed towards it, but when he got there it disappeared. It was a mirage. The sand started moving. A sandworm appeared and on top of it the clockman. Jack tried to run, but it was futile. The worm at him.
<br>Jack woke up from his coma. He’d been in a coma for four years. He couldn’t believe it, but now everything made sense.
