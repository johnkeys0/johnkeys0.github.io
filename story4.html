                Introduction
<br>“Be on your guard!” – Jack the leader of the White Fangs party remarked, when suddenly three giant wolves appeared in front of them. 
<br>
<br>Sofia: 
<br>We are surrounded! 
 <br>
<br>Jack:
<br>I and Michael will take on the one in front of us. Sofia yours is the left and David take on the right one.
<br>
<br>	The beast attacked Jack, but he was able to dodge and with one fell swoop he cut down the wolfs head. Sofia was able to defeat her adversary and only one wolf remained. Seeing that he was the only one left he chose to flee, but David was able to catch up to him and defeat him.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Nice work guys!
<br>
<br>Everyone:
<br>Thanks!
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Now let’s get back into town and show their remains to the guild so we get our reward.
<br>
<br>Sofia:
<br>This was an easy fight.
<br>
<br>David:
<br>Yeah, it was thanks to our swords.
<br>
<br>Sofia:
<br>It’s true, but maybe our skill had something to do with it as well.
<br>
<br>David:
<br>Yes, but the skin of those beasts is so though, only these adamantite swords can pierce thru them. So don’t become overconfident. It’s not healthy.
<br>
<br>Sofia:
<br>Fine, whatever!
<br>
<br>	After some time they arrived back into town and they immediately went to report back about their mission.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>We successfully exterminated the monsters.
<br>
<br>Guild master Julis:
<br>Good job, everyone!
<br>
<br>White Fangs party:
<br>Thank you guild master!
<br>
<br>Julius:
<br>I’ve got a new job for you.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>What is it guild master?
<br>
<br>Julius:
<br>There is some new monsters that need to be exterminated in the dark forest.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>The dark forest?! That place is incredibly dangerous!
<br>
<br>Julius:
<br>I know, but I believe you’ll be able to handle it. There has been a sighting of five fox tailed beasts in the forest. Will you accept this quest.
<br>
<br>The party:
<br>We will!
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Alright, everyone! Let’s get some rest, because we’ll have a long day ahead of us!
<br>
<br>Sofia:
<br>Jack, can I ask you something?
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Yeah! What is on your mind?
<br>
<br>Sofia:
<br>Are you sure we’ll be able to handle this quest, I mean the amount of that went missing because of it is somewhat terrifying.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Don’t worry! I am quite sure about our capability. Everything’s going to be alright.
<br>
<br>Sofia:
<br>Thank you! That sounds reassuring.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>No problem.
<br>
<br>	All of them went to rest so they could be fresh for tomorrows mission.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Good morning, everyone!
<br>
<br>Everyone:
<br>Good morning!
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Alright! Let’s talk about the strategy we’ll use for this fight. First we’ll scout out the area and if we see a fox tailed beast we’ll attack from it’s blind spot. It’s important for us to stick together, so no wandering off. That’s all! Now let’s get to work!
<br>
<br>	They began their journey to the dark forest which is one day away on foot, but luckily they went with a carriage and so they arrived relatively fast.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Alright everyone! Be on your guard, as always!
<br>
<br>David:
<br>I think I saw something. To our right.
<br>
	<br>A fox tailed beast appeared.
<br>
<br>Michael:
<br>I got this. – he went straight ahead to kill the monster.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Wait, don’t go! We have to work together. – it was too late. Michael got hit by the monster.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Let’s surround the beast.
<br>
<br>Everyone:
<br>Got it! 
<br>
<br>	They were able to defeat the beast.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>One down four more to go. Are you alright Michael?
<br>
<br>Michael:
<br>Yes! It’s just a scratch.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>I’m glad to hear that. Next time wait for us instead of running straight ahead into battle.
<br>
<br>Michael:
<br>Yes boss!
<br>
<br>Battle after battle they were able to defeat all five fox tailed beasts. It took them some time and they got really tired so they headed back home.
<br>
<br>David:
<br>I see something!
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>What?
<br>
<br>David:
<br>I don’t know. Something shiny, over to the left.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Yeah, I see it. Let’s check it out, but be vigilant!
<br>
<br>Everyone:
<br>Yes, sir!
<br>
<br>	They went to check out what they had seen and it was some kind of whit metal when suddenly it opened and somebody dressed in strange clothing came out of it.
<br>			The War
<br>Mark:
<br>Ok! I’m off.
<br>
<br>Daniel:
<br>I don’t think this is a good idea. I think something terrible will happen.
<br>
<br>Mark:
<br>Don’t worry nothing bad will happen.
<br>
<br>Daniel:
<br>I wish you all the best.
<br>
<br>World war III has been going on for the past five years. New weapons of mass distraction have been created. The most notable one, a biological weapon, so called “Monsters”. They have incredibly tick skin, not even a nuclear bomb could kill them, so a new weapon was created to combat these beasts, known as adamantite swords. Adamantite, an artificial material is the only thing capable of killing these monsters.
<br>Mark and a couple of people tried to leave Earth because of the war, but they were seen as deserters, so their rocket got shut down and they perished.
<br>Daniel is a brilliant scientist who knew what was going to happen, but Mark didn’t listen to him, came up with a different idea: cryostasis. His plan was to freeze himself and wake up later, but something went wrong and instead of waking up a couple of years later he woke up centuries later and was about to meet a new group of people.
<br>			The meeting
<br>Jack:
<br>Who are you!?
<br>
<br>Daniel:
<br>My name is Daniel Millan and who are you?
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>My name is Jack and this is my team. How did you end up in the middle of the forest?
<br>
<br>Daniel:
<br>That is a long story.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>We’ll have to take you to the guild master where you’ll have to explain yourself.
<br>
<br>Daniel:
<br>Is he your leader?
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>He’s our boss.
<br>
<br>Daniel:
<br>I understand.
<br>
<br>	Jack and the others took Daniel to the guild master for questioning. Jack was flabbergasted, he didn’t know who this strange individual was. After some time they arrived at the guild. Daniel explained everything to the guild master and to Jack and his friends. They couldn’t believe what they were hearing. Now everything made sense: the origin of the monsters and why adamantite was the only weapon capable of harming them. 
<br>
<br>				Daniels first mission
<br>Daniel became an adventurer. It is a huge glory for someone to become an adventurer, because only than they receive an adamantite sword. 
<br>
<br>Guild master:
<br>The quest is as follows: kill a fox-tailed beast.
<br>
<br>Daniel:
<br>I understand!
<br>
<br>Guild master:
<br>Good luck!
<br>
<br>Daniel and the white fangs party went to deal with the beast in question. “There it is!” – Jack remarked and pointed to its position. Daniel charged ahead and was able to defeat the beast with one fell swoop.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>Good job Daniel.
<br>
<br>Daniel:
<br>Thank you!
<br>
<br>They headed back to the guild where the guild master had another quest for them. A very strange one indeed.
<br>				The strange quest
<br>The quest seemed rather simple: check out an aria where an earthquake happened. Daniel and the white fangs party went to check it out, but what they found was rather strange. There was a cave opening and they decided to see what is inside. They couldn’t believe their eyes: there was a dragon sleeping inside. Fear came over them, so Jack had to step in to calm them down.
<br>
<br>Daniel:
<br>This is not good. I know this weapon. The earthquake might have been caused by the dragon. When someone tries to wake it up and fails it shakes drastically, creating an earthquake.
<br>
<br>Jack:
<br>I see. We need to report back to the guild master immediately.
<br>
<br>Daniel:
<br>Agreed!
<br>
<br>They went back to report what they had seen to the guild master. The guild master had a terrified look on his face. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Daniel went away to do some research.
<br>				The calamity
<br>Suddenly the dragon appeared and was spitting fire everywhere. The white fangs party tried their best to defeat the dragon, but to no avail, when suddenly Daniel showed up with a special gun. He fired it at the dragon and was able to defeat it. That was the reason he “disappeared” so he could find out a way to defeat the dragon. Who set off the dragon. We’ll never know, but one thing remains clear: Daniel found his place in this new and strange world.
