            Jack stood next to the fire and waited for something to happen, but nothing did, until he heard some weird noise. It was a pack of wolves that surrounded the camp. One of the wolves launched itself onto Jack. He had no idea what to do next, so he yelled as loud as he could until he heard a gunshot. It was Cassandra who shot the wolf and saved him.
            With that the others got scared and ran away howling in the night. Alexandre finally woke up and they explained what had happened and morning finally arrived.
