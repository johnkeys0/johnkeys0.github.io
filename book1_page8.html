            It must have been my friend. He got it from somewhere, but I didn’t ask question because I thought all this demon stuff was a joke, a fun way to spend time. I was very wrong.<br><br>
            Julius:<br>
            We know. In fact we’ve been on your track for quite some time, but due to the lack of manpower we were very late. You see, the demon you summoned is one of the most powerful, if not the MOST powerful demon. It’s name is Armageddon. Quite a fitting name for it’s strength if you ask me. Now we must stop him, so I ask: Will you help us Jack?
